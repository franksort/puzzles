# QUESTION
# Taken from Interview Cake, interviewcake.com
#
# Writing interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe trading Apple
# stocks will.
#
# I have an array stockPricesYesterday where:
#
# * The indices are the time, as a number of minutes past trade opening time,
#   which was 9:30am local time.
# * The values are the price of Apple stock at that time, in dollars.
#   For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so
#   stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made
# from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday. For this problem, we
# won't allow "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell.

# ANSWER
#
# Since we know the market opens at 9:30am, what time does the market close?
#
# Google: "what time does stock market close?"
# Result: 4:00pm
# 
# How long is the stock market open?
# 9:30am to 4:00pm is 6h30m
# 6 * 60m = 360m
# 360m + 30m = 390m
# The stock market is open for 390m.
#
# Our prices array will have 390 elements, a price for each minute the market
# is open.
#
# Is this a 0-indexed array or does the array start at 1?
# According to the example, at 10:30am the array index is 60.
# prices[0] = price from 9:30:00am to 9:30:59am
# prices[1] = price from 9:31:00am to 9:31:59am
# prices[2] = price from 9:32:00am to 9:32:59am
# ...
# prices[59] = price from 10:29:00am to 10:29:59am
# prices[60] = price from 10:30:00am to 10:30:59am
# ...
# prices[389] = price from 4:29:00pm to 4:29:59pm
# Yes the array is 0-indexed.  Its first index is 0, last index is 389.

# Create an array for yesterday's prices with 390 elements.
#prices = Array.new(390)
prices = Array.new(10)

# Fill array with random prices, in the range of 450 to 550 to be somewhat
# realistic.

As we traverse the array of prices, we look at the current price and ask
if current price minus the lowest price occuring to the left is the current
maximum profit.
